# 🎭 Deepfake Detection with Python

This project demonstrates how to detect deepfake videos using Python by analyzing image data from face frames and classifying them with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to distinguish real videos from manipulated ones.

## 📦 Features
- Frame extraction from videos
- Preprocessing face data
- CNN model for classification
- Evaluation with training history visualization

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Deepfake_Detection.ipynb
   ```

## 🧠 ML Technique Used
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- TensorFlow/Keras for model building

## 📊 Dataset

### 📜 Why include a license?

A license tells others what they can and can't do with your code. Without a license, others technically don't have permission to use, copy, modify, or distribute your code.

### 🔑 About MIT License
