# 🎭 Deepfake Detection with Python

This project demonstrates how to detect deepfake videos using Python by analyzing image data from face frames and classifying them with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to distinguish real videos from manipulated ones.

## 📦 Features
- Frame extraction from videos
- Preprocessing face data
- CNN model for classification
- Evaluation with training history visualization

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook:
   ```
